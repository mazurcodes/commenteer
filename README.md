## Description

Commenteer is an application specifically designed for media creators to simplify the process of generating multiple comments for their content. It leverages the power of Next.js, TypeScript, and Firebase to provide a seamless user experience.

With Commenteer, creators can easily create custom sets of comments to enhance engagement and interaction with their audience. The application allows users to specify the project name, comment type (positive, negative, neutral, or questions), and the desired quantity of comments.

### Key features of Commenteer:

- **_Easy Comment Generation_**: Commenteer streamlines the process of creating a large number of comments. With just a few simple inputs, YouTube creators can generate a customizable set of comments to be used in their videos.

- **_Random Comment Generation_**: Commenteer ensures that the generated comments are randomized, providing a diverse and natural-sounding set of comments for YouTube creators.

- **_Firebase Authentication_**: Commenteer utilizes Firebase Authentication to enable secure user registration and login. This ensures that only authorized creators have access to the application.

- **_Firestore Database_**: Commenteer leverages Firebase Firestore as its database solution. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of comment data, ensuring optimal performance.
